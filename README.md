🫀 Heartwise: AI-Powered ECG Monitoring System

An AI/ML-powered real-time ECG monitoring system for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection and risk assessment.
📌 Problem Statement

🔴 Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) cause 18M+ deaths annually. Early detection is crucial, but ECG tests are infrequent, expensive, and require clinical visits. Many heart abnormalities go unnoticed until it’s too late.
🚀 Solution

✅ Heartwise is a real-time, AI-driven ECG monitoring system that:

    📡 Uses biosensors (AD8232 ECG module) to collect real-time ECG signals.
    🧠 Processes ECG signals using AI/ML models (CNN + LSTM) for arrhythmia detection.
    📊 Extracts key ECG features automatically (QRS, HRV, RR-intervals).
    🏥 Provides instant risk assessment & personalized health reports.
    📲 Works as a web-based platform for easy access.

🛠️ Tech Stack

🔹 Hardware: ESP32, AD8232 ECG Sensor
🔹 Backend: Python (Flask), Firebase (Real-time database)
🔹 AI/ML Models: CNN + LSTM for ECG classification
🔹 Feature Extraction: Signal processing techniques, tsfresh
🔹 Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
